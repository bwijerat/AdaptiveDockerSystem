## How to read excel sheets:
Meaurements are saved in log_file_observations.csv:\
sql_cpu_avg WW_cpu_avg sql_mem_avg web_worker_mem_avg minutes_since_start seconds_since_start

Predictions are saved in log_file_results.csv are written as:\
sql_cpu_pred WW_cpu_pred sql_mem_pred web_worker_mem_pred sql_containers_count WW_containers_count delta_requests requests iteration minutes_since_start seconds_since_start 

## To run software:
python main.py\
**--node_list**\
list of IP addresses for docker quieries (typically nodeIP address port 4000)\
**--req_list**\
list of IP addresses to send requests to (typically nodeIP address port 80)\
**--manager**\
IP address of the manager node (typically nodeIP address port 4000)\
**--number_loads**\
number of load processes\
**--poll_interval**\
time in seconds between estimations\
**--polls_per_update**\
number of estimates before the system updates parameters\
**--log_file**\
path to file where results are stored
